# Getting Started with Building your TSP Solver Website

![alt text](https://github.com/brianhumphreys/wasm-go-tsp-lesson/blob/master/github-assets/tsp-image.png?raw=true)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Website

You can visit the deployed [site](https://lakaar.com) that compares the Two-Opt, Genetic and Simulated Annealing algorithms for solving the Traveling Salesperson Problem or you can run it yourself on your machine!

When you run the web app, you should see something like this...

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
